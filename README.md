# JavaScript

## Quick Overview
- Abbreviated as JS
- Created in 1995 by Netscape


## Motivations for Mastering JavaScript
- **Established and Demanded**: JS is essential for web development. Several popular libraries and frameworks are created on top of JS: jQuery, React, Angular, Vue.js. Also, TypeScript, a programming language that builds on JS, adds static typing. A deep dive in JS will allow one to explore many other popular tools faster.
- **Versatile**: JS can be used for both front-end development (with frameworks like Angular, React, Vue.js) and back-end development (with Node.js). It can be run on web browsers, servers, mobile devices.


## Running JavaScript Programs
There are several ways to develop with JS.
- **Using Nodejs**: install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and execute a script using command: `node script.js`
- **Developer Console**: modern browsers come with built-in developer tools, including a JS console.
